                <p>
                    Our users are frustrated when attempting to split the bill between drinkers and nondrinkers. Drinkers may take advantage of bill splitting to buy multiple drinks causing a split of the bill to be unfair. Our solution would provide users with an easy way to split the bill without taking drinks into consideration.
